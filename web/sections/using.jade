h3 Using keyword

p The using keyword imports functions from an object into the current scope. For example if we have a library called "ninja" which exposes two methods jump and kick.

textarea
  N = require "ninja"
  using * from N
  jump "high"
  kick()

p If we only wanted to import jump, we could write: 

textarea 
  N = require "ninja"
  using jump from N
  jump "high"

p Note: that the * form uses eval, so it won’t work with ES5 strict, and also be careful putting it in sections of code that are often called.
